 It's been over a year since I wrote 2017: A Post Mortem, and a lot has happened!

It's been over a year since I wrote 2017: A Post Mortem, and a lot has happened! In list form:

## The good:
* The new job I talked about? Turned out it wasn't for me, so I quit in June, and started at [NOS](https://nos.nl/) the same month.
* I no longer think of myself as a junior developer and I'm not struggling with Imposter's Syndrome as much as I did in 2017.
* I gave a talk: [you can read my blog post about it here](https://nienkedekker.com/blog/designing-and-developing-for-users-with-autism).
* I helped organize a succesful edition of [Fronteers Conference](https://fronteers.nl/congres/2017).
* I co-organized the third (and unfortunately, final) edition of the[ Stupid Hackathon Amsterdam](https://stupidhackathon.wtf/).
* I learned a ton about ES6, Node, and Vue. But I also took a deep dive into OOP and design patterns.

## The less than ideal:
* I managed to open source _zero_ side projects, even though I did tons of things ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
* I didn't contribute to any open source projects, even though that was my goal last year.
* I didn't write more blog posts (another goal from last year).

## On quitting a job less than six months in
In December 2017 I started a new job at a design agency. It's a great company and I had amazing co-workers, but after a few months I had to admit to myself that A) I did not like interacting with clients and B) I couldn't care less about the product I worked on. In order to enjoy my job, I need to work on something that I'd personally use. At the agency, I was working on a website for dairy farmers to keep track of the quality of their milk..so that wasn't ideal. The work itself was interesting: I learned a lot about ES6 and advanced Sass (and even some C#!), but the idea I was spending 40 hours a week working on a thing me or anyone I know would never use was pretty depressing. It felt like my work didn't matter.

So I switched jobs and now I work on a website that I personally use as well, and it's been great. Even the fact that our codebase contains a lot of legacy doesn't really have any impact on how much I enjoy the work. It's now *my* legacy codebase and that's all that matters. Having a connection with the thing you work on is so important (YMMV, of course).

## Some lists
* I visited four countries: Romania, Germany, Portugal and Scotland, where I hiked the [West Highland Way](https://www.westhighlandway.org/) (10/10 would recommend, but don't be like me and lose 4 of your toenails)
* I read **61** books. My favorite? [The Broken Earth](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/17/16156416/n-k-jemisin-broken-earth-trilogy-the-stone-sky-fantasy-book-review) series by N.K. Jemisin.
* I watched **31** movies. I enjoyed [Shirkers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7472352/), [Annihilation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2798920/), and [The Death of Stalin](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4686844/) the most.
* I watched **38** TV show seasons and I have _tons_ of favorites. Dirk Gently, The Terror, Westworld, Legion, The Expanse, Colony, Castlevania.. 2018 was a great year for TV!
* I [scrobbled](https://www.last.fm/user/shinyhats/listening-report/year) 16,448 songs. Some of my favorite albums of 2018 are (with links to reviews):
	* [The Armed - Only Love](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-armed-only-love/)
	* [Deafheaven - Ordinary Corrupt Human Love](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/13/deafheaven-ordinary-corrupt-human-love-review-anti)
	* [Rico Nasty - Nasty](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rico-nasty-nasty/)
	* [Death Grips - Year Of The Snitch](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/death-grips-year-of-the-snitch/)
	* [070 Shake - Glitter](https://pitchfork.com/features/rising/get-to-know-070-shake-good-musics-shape-shifting-secret-weapon/)
	* [Summer of Haze - P A C I F I C A](https://www.discogs.com/Summer-Of-Haze-P-A-C-I-F-I-C-A/release/12573439/)

I have some goals for 2019, and they're largely the same as last year's: write good code and try to give back by open sourcing projects or contributing to existing open source projects. Maybe learn some React ‡≠ß(‚Ä¢ÃÄ·¥ó‚Ä¢ÃÅ‡πë)·µí·µè·µé·µé·µé·µé

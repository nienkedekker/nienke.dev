[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/934c1057-a24e-4d91-8290-f18aaf0f8012/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/nienkedekker-com/deploys)

My personal [website](https://www.nienke.dev), where you can find information about me and where I sometimes (rarely (never)) blog. It runs on [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org) and is deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). 

## Install locally
### Clone
First, clone the repo: 
```
git@github.com:nienkedekker/nienke.dev.git
```

### Install
Then, install the dependencies by running `yarn install`. You can use npm, but make sure to delete the `yarn.lock` file then.

### Run
Run the project with `yarn dev` and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Blog posts
New blog posts can be added to the `blog/posts` folder. An array of posts is generated by `generatePosts.js` and is written to the file `generatedPosts.js`. We can't generate the blog posts on the fly because we're using `nuxt generate` to create a static website.
